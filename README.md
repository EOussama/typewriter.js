## Documentation
### The constructor

```js
TypeWriter (options: Object)
```
This constructor is used to instantiate typewriter objects that are responsible for producing the animations.

### `typewriter` options.

|  Option  |                                     Description                                   | Default value |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
|  target  |  The element you want to perform the animation on must be a valid HTML element.  |   undefined   |
|  speed   |  The time between outputting each character in milliseconds.                       |   1500        |

After instantiating a typewriter object, we can use all sort of method to control and customize the animation, here's a list of available methods.

* type
* delete
* stop
* clear
* moveCursor

### Example
```html
<!-- index.html -->

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>
    <body>
        <p id="target"></p>
    </body>
</html>
```

```js
// main.js

var tw = new TypeWriter({
    target: document.getElementById('target'),
    speed: 300
});

tw.type({
    script: '_Lorem Ipsum!_',
    endCallback: () => alert('Animation finished!');
});
```

That would output '_Lorem Ipsum!_' in the paragraph element as if it's being written with a scrapped typewriter, each character will take _300 milliseconds_ to be output, and will trigger a function to execute when it's finished, alerting '_Animation finished!_' for the user.

In order to stop the animation at any point, we can utilize the `stop` function;

```js
// main.js

setTimeout(() => {
    tw.stop();
}, 1000);
```

That will stop the animation after a second had passed.
